# Sweet Time
A utility for facilitating timed responses during debates.

## Usage instructions
This application is intended to be used with one or two monitors. With the latter solution, the browser window should be positioned such that the left portion of the application (with the control buttons) remains on the primary display, for the moderator to manage, while the big timer on the right should appear on the secondary display. This secondary display should face the speaker and act as an visual aid for the amount of time remaining.

The bar on the left contains the following buttons, from top to bottom:

- `clear`: Zero out the clock.
- `120s`: Click once to prime the clock to 120 seconds. Click again to start the timer.
- `60s`: Click once to prime the clock to 60 seconds. Click again to start the timer.
- `30s`: Click once to prime the clock to 30 seconds. Click again to start the timer.
